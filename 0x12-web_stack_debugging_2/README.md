# Web stack debugging #2
This was the third in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers, and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the web stack.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
- 0. Run software as another user
  - [0-iamsomeoneelse](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x12-web_stack_debugging_2/0-iamsomeoneelse): Bash script that runs the command `whoami` under the user passed as argument. 
  - Usage: `./0-iamsomeonelese <user>`
