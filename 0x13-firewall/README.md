# Firewall
In this project, I used `ufw` to configure firewalls on my issued web servers.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

  - [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x13-firewall/0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but): Bash script that installs a `ufw` firewall to block all incoming traffic except for ports `22`, `443` and `80` on a web server.
