# Application server
This was the application deployment project for our AirBnB clone. In this project, I configured Nginx on the web servers provided me by ALX to serve a WSGI Flask app running through Gunicorn. Additionally, I set up an Upstart script to keep the application running on server reboots.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
- 0. Set up development with Python
    - In this task, I configured the file `web_flask/0-hello_route.py` from my [AirBnB_clone_v2](https://github.com/richard-1257/AirBnB_clone_v2) to serve content on the route `/airbnb-onepage/,` running on port `5000.`

- 1. Set up production with Gunicorn
  - This task involved setting up a production environment, installing and configuring Gunicorn to serve the same file from task 0.
 
- 2. Serve a page with Nginx
  - [2-app_server-nginx_config](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x1A-application_server/2-app_server-nginx_config): Nginx configuration file proxying requests on the route `/airbnb-onepage/` to the Gunicorn app running on port `5000`.

- 3. Add a route with query parameters
  - [3-app_server-nginx_config](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x1A-application_server/3-app_server-nginx_config): Nginx configuration file proxying requests on the route `/airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/<int: num>` to the Gunicorn app running on port `5000`.
