# Networking basics #0

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
- 0. OSI model
     - [0-OSI_model](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/0-OSI_model): Text file answering the following questions:
     - What is the OSI model?
             a. Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
             b. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.
             c. The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology.
     - How is the OSI model organized?
            a. Alphabetically
            b. From the lowest to the highest level
            c. Randomly
            
- 1. Types of network
     - [1-types_of_network](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/1-types_of_network): Text file answering the following questions:
     - What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
            a. Internet
            b. WAN
            c. LAN
     - What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
            a. Internet
            b. WAN
            c. LAN
     - What network do you use when you browse [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
            a. Internet
            b. WAN
            c. LAN
            
- 2. MAC and IP address
     - [2-MAC_and_IP_address](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/2-MAC_and_IP_address): Text file answering the following questions:
     - What is a MAC address?
             a. The name of a network interface
             b. The unique identifier of a network interface
             c. A network interface
     - What is an IP address?
             a. Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
             b. The unique identifier of a network interface
             c. Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks
             
- 3. UDP and TCP
     - [3-UDP_and_TCP](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/3-UDP_and_TCP): Text file answering the following questions (boxes refer to an image provided by ALX):
     - Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
             a. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
             b. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
     - Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
             a. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
             b. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
     - Which statement is correct for the TCP worker
             a. Have you received boxes x, y, z?
             b. May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?
             
- 4. TCP and UDP ports
     - [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): Bash script that displays listening ports.
     - Only shows listening sockets.
     - Displays the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
     
- 5. Is the host on the network
     - [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/5-is_the_host_on_the_network): Bash script that pings an IP address received as an argument 5 times.
     - Usage: `5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}`.
