# API

This project was further practice in working with API's. I collected data from the JSONPlaceholder REST API, and learned how to export it to either CSV or JSON format.

## Tasks 📃
- 0. Gather data from an API
  - [0-gather_data_from_an_API.py](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x15-api/0-gather_data_from_an_API.py): Python script that returns information on the to-do list progress of a given employee ID.
  - Usage: `python3 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee ID>`.
  - Output: `Employee <employee name> is done with tasks(<# completed tasks>/<total # tasks>)`:
