Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced building them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

All code in this directory was tested using Rubular. Rubular is a Ruby-based regular expression editor. It's a handy way to test regular expressions as you write them Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line.
