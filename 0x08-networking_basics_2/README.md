# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
- 0. Change your home IP
     - [0-change_your_home_IP](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x08-networking_basics_2/0-change_your_home_IP): Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as follows:
     - `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
     - `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`
            
- 1. Show attached IPs
     - [1-show_attached_IPs](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x08-networking_basics_2/1-show_attached_IPs): Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on the machine.
            
- 2. Port listening on localhost
     - [100-port_listening_on_localhost](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x08-networking_basics_2/100-port_listening_on_localhost): Bash script that listens on port `98` on `localhost`.
